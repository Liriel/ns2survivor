#Natural Selection 2: Survivor

Bringing back the classic survial game mode from AvP2 (2001) in Natural Selection 2.

##Gameplay

The survial game mode is basically a regular [Last Man Standing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_man_standing_%28gaming%29) game mode with some small modifications:

*  Players who get killed do not have to wait for the next Round

###FRAG YOUR NEIGHBOUR

As soon as all Players have joined the Marines it's ***FRAG YOUR NEIGHBOUR*** time!
To determine who will be the first Alien (and therefore not get any points for surving in this round) friendly fire is activated. The first Marine that is killed will become the initial Alien and the next gamephase begins:
